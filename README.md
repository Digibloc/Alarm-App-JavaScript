# Alarm-App-JavaScript
An alarm app built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
I create a project folder called – ‘Alarm App’. The folder consists of three files. These files are index.html, style.css and script.js.
Begin with HTML code.
Next, we style our app using CSS.

Finally, we implement the functionality using javascript. We do this in the following steps:

Create Initial References
Append zeroes for single digit
Search for value in the object
Display time
Display time(with zeroes appended)
Create alarm div
Set alarm
Start Alarm
Stop Alarm
Delete Alarm
